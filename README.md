# public-key-pinning-ios
Sample implementation of public key pinning for iOS.

## Prerequisites
- MacOS with openssl
- XCode 12
- Swift 5

## Public key pinning
Note: no theory is explained here. This serves only as an example implementation for iOS.

### 1. Retrieve public key from a host. For this example we will use https://github.com (note that public key may change over time). Launch Terminal app and type:
```
openssl s_client -connect github:443 -showcerts < /dev/null | openssl x509 -outform der > server_cert.der
```
```
openssl x509 -inform der -in server_cert.der -pubkey -noout > server_cert_public_key.pem
```
```
cat server_cert_public_key.pem | openssl rsa -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64
```

You'll get github's hashed public key (base64 encoded):
```

```
Store this key in some constant in your project.
See 'retrieve_public_key.sh' example.

### 2. Set delegate of NSURLSession and implement NSURLSessionDelegate's method:
```
func urlSession(_ session: URLSession, didReceive challenge: URLAuthenticationChallenge, completionHandler: @escaping (URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition, URLCredential?) -> Void)
```

### 3. If challenge.protectionSpace.authenticationMethod == NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust do the pinning:

Evaluate trust for the specified certificate:
```
if let serverTrust = challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust {
    var secresult: CFError? = nil
    let certTrusted = SecTrustEvaluateWithError(serverTrust, &secresult)
```
If certificate is trusted, retrieve the certificate you want to do the pinning against. In the chain of trust, I will pick the leaf certificate, which is always at index 0:
```
let serverCertificate = SecTrustGetCertificateAtIndex(serverTrust, 0)
```
Get public key for this certificate:
```
let publicKey = SecCertificateCopyKey(serverCertificate)
```
Represent it as Data:
```
var error: Unmanaged<CFError>?
let publicKeyData = SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation(publicKey, &error) as Data?
```
PublicKeyData is missing asn1 header. We need to add it, so we get the same hash:
```
let rsa2048Asn1Header: [UInt8] = [
        0x30, 0x82, 0x01, 0x22, 0x30, 0x0d, 0x06, 0x09, 0x2a, 0x86, 0x48, 0x86,
        0xf7, 0x0d, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x05, 0x00, 0x03, 0x82, 0x01, 0x0f, 0x00
      ]
var keyWithHeader = Data(rsa2048Asn1Header)
keyWithHeader.append(publicKeyData)
```
Now we have the same key, let's hash:
```
let digest = SHA256.hash(data: keyWithHeader)
```
And base64:
```
let digestString = Data(digest).base64EncodedString()
```
Now you can compare if digestString equals our stored hash from step 1.
